Database Testing Automation 🚀🧪📊

This project demonstrates effective automation of database operations using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and JDBC. It's designed to efficiently handle common database tasks such as insertion, updating, reading, and deletion of records in a structured and automated manner. ⚙️📁💡

Project Overview 📚🔍🛠️

This automation script interacts with a MySQL database, classicmodels, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, crucial for thorough database testing. 🧾📂✅

Key Functionalities:

Insert Records: Adds multiple new customer records into the database efficiently.

Update Records: Modifies existing customer data to simulate real-world update operations.

Read Records: Retrieves specific customer data for verification and validation.

Delete Records: Removes specified customer entries to ensure clean database state.

Technologies Used 💻🔧🧰

Java: Core programming language for script development.

TestNG: Organizes and prioritizes test execution.

Selenium WebDriver (commented): Potential web integration testing.

JDBC: Connects and communicates with the MySQL database.

MySQL: Database management system for storing and manipulating data.

Setup Instructions 🛠️📥📌

Install MySQL Server: Ensure MySQL is installed locally with classicmodels database setup.

Configure Database Connection: Adjust database URL, username, and password in beforetest() method.

Dependencies: Add JDBC, TestNG, and Selenium (if needed) dependencies to your project.

Execution ▶️🧾📈

Run tests sequentially based on priority.

Each test operation outputs its results in the console for easy verification.

Ideal Use Cases 🎯🧠🔬

Testing database integrity during development.

Automated regression testing for database-backed applications.

Validating database CRUD operations during CI/CD pipeline execution.

Enjoy seamless database testing automation with clarity and precision! ✨📊✅
